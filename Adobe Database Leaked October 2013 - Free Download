In October 2013, 153 million Adobe accounts were breached with each containing an
internal ID, username, email, encrypted password and a password hint in plain text.
The password cryptography was poorly done and many were quickly resolved back to
plain text. The unencrypted hints also disclosed much about the passwords adding
further to the risk that hundreds of millions of Adobe customers already faced.

Compromised data: Email addresses, Password hints, Passwords, Usernames

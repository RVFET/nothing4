Ledger has fallen victim to a cyber attack and confidential data belonging to
approximately 81,000 customers has been illegally obtained by an unauthorized
third party. To be more specific, on 11th of November 2020, members of Ledger

Live's administrative servers. Despite Ledger relentless efforts, as of today,

this data breach. Due to these circumstances, you must assume that your funds
could be at risk of theft.

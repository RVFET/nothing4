In October 2019, security researchers identified an unprotected Elasticsearch server
holding 1.2 billion records of personal data. The exposed data included an index indicating
it was sourced from data enrichment company People Data Labs (PDL) and contained 622 million
unique email addresses. The server was not owned by PDL and it's believed a customer failed
to properly secure the database. Exposed information included email addresses, phone numbers,
social media profiles and job history data.

- Create and start a Hotspot with custom name and password.
- Create and start a Fake Hotspot with the name of a existing Hotspot to knock it out.
- Shows all the Wifi Networks near you
- Deletes records of used Wifi connections
- Get the password of active Wifi Networks. Check Security > Key Content

just name the hotspot with the same SSID (Including Caps). Any device that tries to
connect to the network with the other router password will have their authentication failed.

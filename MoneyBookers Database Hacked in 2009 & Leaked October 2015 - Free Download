Sometime in 2009, the e-wallet service known as Money Bookers suffered a data breach which exposed
almost 4.5M customers. Now called Skrill, the breach was not discovered until October 2015 and
included names, email addresses, home addresses and IP addresses.

Note: One of my first emails is in this database and after verification it is a match. It
includes First and Last name, Mobile number, Address, Postal Code, Language, Date of Birth and IP.
